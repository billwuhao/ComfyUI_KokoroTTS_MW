So, what exactly is artificial intelligence?\n\n[S2] Great question. \nSimply put, Artificial Intelligence , \nor AI, is a type of technology that allows machines to learn, reason, perceive, \nand make decisions — much like humans do.\n\n[S1] So does that mean AI is just robots? Like the talking robots you see in movies?\n\n[S2] Not exactly. \nWhile robots can be part of AI, \nAI mostly refers to the algorithms and models behind them. \nFor example, your phone’s voice assistant, video recommendation systems, \nor even self-driving cars — all of these use AI.\n\n[S1] Wow, I didn’t realize that! Is AI already very smart? \nCould it ever surpass humans?\n\n[S2] That's an interesting question. \nToday’s AI is known as narrow AI — it can outperform humans in specific tasks like playing chess or recognizing images, \nbut it doesn’t have self-awareness or emotions. \nThe concept of artificial general intelligence , \nmeaning a machine that thinks and understands as broadly as humans do, is still theoretical and under research."]}],"links":[[14,22,0,26,0,"STRING"],[15,26,0,24,0,"AUDIO"],[18,26,0,28,0,"AUDIO"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":1.1,"offset":[204.44241437044997,12.45075364546334]}},"version":0.4}
